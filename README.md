# Who_is_the_true_GOAT

The project aims to address the subjective nature of the "Greatest NBA Player of All Time" (GOAT) debate by utilizing NBA sports analytics and engaging visuals. The project introduces an interactive dashboard that allows users to objectively evaluate players based on various factors, encouraging a more sophisticated understanding of an NBA player's legacy. The challenge lies in handling data inconsistencies and adapting to changes in the game over different eras. The visualizations focus on accuracy, correctness, and truth, incorporating complex attributes and multivariate graphs to present data-backed analyses. The goal is to promote an objective comparison of players, enhance appreciation for the sport's history, and facilitate informed discussions through accessible and engaging visualizations.
