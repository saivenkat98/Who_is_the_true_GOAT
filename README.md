# Who_is_the_true_GOAT
ABSTRACT:
A quick Google search for the phrase "Best NBA player of all time" yields an astounding number of results,
underscoring the GOAT debate's enormous appeal to basketball's 400 million plus global followers. Basketball
frequently stirs up powerful emotions that can make it difficult to think clearly because it is a sport that is
ingrained in American society. To counteract this, our initiative makes use of the NBA's sports analytics and
enticing visuals to provide users with data-driven insights that help the GOAT discussion become more
understandable.
Users can objectively evaluate the success of different players by looking at several important factors, and
they can then come to their own well-informed, fact-based conclusions regarding whether players genuinely
deserve the title of GOAT.
To further improve the fan experience, I created an interactive dashboard that enables users to assess
team performance, strengths, and weaknesses by comparing important parameters of their favorite clubs
against those of other teams.
In essence, our approach encourages a more sophisticated understanding of the various aspects that contribute
to an NBA player's legacy and team stats comparison methodologies. I utilized the power of
visualizations to help end users derive valid conclusions in simplest way possible.

INTRODUCTION:
The GOAT discussion is essentially subjective, with individual likes and feelings swaying viewpoints. It is
difficult to create a neutral strategy that reduces prejudice and accurately depicts players' contributions. It can
be challenging to create an interactive platform that serves individuals with different basketball expertise and
interest levels. To encourage wide adoption, it is essential to make sure the visualizations are interesting,
simple to interpret, and instructive.
Working on Solving the GOAT debate and bringing up visual dashboards to asses and compare player and
team statistics was challenging as most of the data available online is inconsistent , unlike choosing best player
of series of season , concluding GOAT player indulges challenges like players belonging to different Era with
lot of changes in rules , structure of the game and other conditions ,I focused obtaining metrics over a
period of time and have considered cumulative and derived fields to analyze their performance over a
significant period of time.
I developed visual dashboards for team statistics analysis or comparison allows end users to get quick
insights just by looking at the data and performing few or minimal actions .
Accuracy , correctness, and truth are vital aspects of any visualization , significant time was spent on
performing necessary analysis or retrospections to make sure the key objective of the visualizations is retained
Following is some of the justifications that were considered make this visualization effective and truthful
• Is it better than doing automatically ? – I tried to bring in complex attributes or multivariate
graphs to make sure I was using enough data backed by facts to present our analysis , any such
inferences would be difficult to perceive by looking at the raw data or by automating 
• How do you know it works? – I tried various visualizations which adhere to different questions/
validations each kind of visualization will either have its own purpose or will implicate the necessity
to have another visualization , making it a understandable story
• Is it faster ? More Fun ? – I implemented interactive features like color scales , tooltips to
provide information at quick glance and make it visually appealing
• Why is the design better than another ? – well , it’s a subjective question but I focused on
making sure to provide the inferences that I tend to present and each of the visualizations is backed
more by data rather than assumptions , amalgamation of all these will hit the point of proving who the
GOAT is precisely
Solving the GOAT (Greatest of All Time) debate in basketball and having a effective visualization for quick
stats comparison of teams is important because it promotes an objective comparison of players, enhancing
appreciation for the sport and its history. A data-driven approach encourages fans to recognize the diverse
aspects of a player's/team’s legacy and engage in informed discussions. Relevant work in this field has
primarily focused on statistical analysis, both traditional and advanced metrics. However, our project aims
to build upon these efforts by integrating interactive visualizations and providing an accessible platform for
users to explore and analyze player performance, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of the
GOAT debate and statistics-based comparisons catered by effective visualizations.
